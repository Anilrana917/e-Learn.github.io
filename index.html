            The full sentence it came from is: “Those who emphasise the functional nature of literacy, who believe that there is a set of basic competences to be taught and learned according to a single pattern of instruction, will have difficulty with the underlying assumptions of this chapter: that literacy is too important to .

            Peter High: I have had the chance to speak with multiple of your colleagues at Singularity University, though none with as broad a purview as you have. I thought maybe, given your high perch in the organization and your long tenure with it since its founding in 2008, you could talk a bit about the unmet need that led to the creation of Singularity University, especially at its founding; as well as how the organization has evolved in the eight plus years since.

            In 2011, Rob Nail thought he was retired. Never mind that he was only 15 years out of undergrad. He had co-founded Velocity 11, a robotics company that pioneered automation technology solutions for life science laboratories, and in late 2007, he sold it to Agilent Technologies. He had joined the board of Alite Designs, had become an angel investor, and generally enjoyed himself.
            He elected to take one of the first executive programs at Singularity University (SU), the Silicon Valley think-tank that offers educational programs and that serves as a business incubator, founded by Peter Diamandis and Ray Kurzweil. Whereas he thought he knew a lot about robotics, his exposure to the big thinkers at SU led him to realize that there was much he did not know, and that he was fortunate to have sold his company when he did because of competitive forces that would have made for tough going in the near-term.
            Nail was so taken with SU that he invested time and money in it, and developed a number of ideas for the founders to pursue. Diamandis and Kurzweil were sufficiently impressed to ask him to come on as the organization’s chief executive officer, a role he has held since late 2011.

            If you look through Moore's Law continuing for some time, through the works of Google Loon and Facebook drones and One Web satellite, everybody on the planet is going to be connected within the next five to 10 years. That means they will have access to the greatest education that ever existed. They can get a free degree from MIT today, imagine what five years from now is going to offer. The XPRIZE has this amazing global literacy prize that is a $50 million-dollar prize to build an app that will take someone from complete illiteracy to reading and writing proficiency with 18 months. They are pretty sure somebody will win this within the next two years. With access to IBM Watson, you get the best health care capabilities. Energy is getting cheaper on a 30-year timeline. It will mean that food and water can be cheap. Taken together, on a 30-year timeline, there is a real path towards us having an upper class, Western U.S.-based lifestyle as a baseline for everybody on the planet, all through exponential technologies.
